# Solar

A multiple page site displaying facts about the planets in our solar system. I am using this project to learn how to effectively use SASS, and it is my first website utilizing javascript to manipulate DOM elements.
I plan to use to refactor this project to pull page specific content from a JSON file, Instead of linking to 8 seperate diffrent html pages.

## Features

Multiple pages, JS buttons and content switching, and styles written using SASS.

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* Javascript

## Sources

The figma design files and content for this website are provided by Frontend mentor: <https://www.frontendmentor.io/> and coded by myself, Gabriel Cummnings.
